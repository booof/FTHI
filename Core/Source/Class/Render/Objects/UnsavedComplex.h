// This File Will Handle the Storage of Changes Made to SpringMass
// and Hinge Physics Objects. Since These Object Types Utilize a
// Seperate File for Storing Information, They Will be Handled
// Sperately from Generalized Group Objects. The File Process Will
// Try to Stay Unchanged from the Current SpringMass File Structure,
// Where Objects Are Read First Before Connectors. The Proccess of
// Editing These Objects Should Also Remain the Same.
//
// As of Now, It is Currently Unkown if Objects in a Hinge or SpringMass
// Will be Able to Utilize a General Parent-Child Relationship With Other
// Objects That Are Not Physics Objects. Although it Could Lead to Interesting
// Creations, This May Cause Unneccessary Bloat, and Enough Bloat Might Casue
// This Idea to be Killed Off. Before it is Entirely Killed Off, However, the
// Object Identifier in these Files Will be Expanded to 4-bytes Like the Object
// Identifier for General Group Objects.
